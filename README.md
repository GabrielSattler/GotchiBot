# GotchiBot
  Is a basic discord bot made in discord.js that allows the interaction with a virtual pet via Discord's new buttons.

# Features
<b>Interactions</b>: You can clean, feed and take your pet on walks until it evolves into a new Animal, and if you don't like what you got or you just want to see something new you can reset back to an egg and win some money and a chance to see a different pet.

<b>Customization</b>: You can choose between several premade gotchi frames and backgrounds based on the classic tamagotchi screen look.

<b>Leaderboards</b>: You can see the top 5 players by age pet or by total currency earned,  letting you choose if you want to stick to a pet and go for age or constantly resetting to reach the top in G.
